This project aims to simplify the creation of engaging online stores by providing a robust, modular architecture. The core features include:

- ⚡ **Fast Development Setup**: Integrates Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and seamless styling.
- 🛠️ **Configurable Build Process**: Simplifies environment setup with centralized configuration files.
- 🧹 **Code Quality Assurance**: Enforces best practices with ESLint, supporting maintainability.
- 🎨 **Reusable UI Components**: Modular components like Navbar, Footer, Hero, and Product Cards promote consistency.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dynamic, adaptable layouts.
- 🚀 **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and streamlined scripts for quick iteration.





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
